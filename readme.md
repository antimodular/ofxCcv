# ofxCcv - modified



This is a modified copy of an addon for openFrameworks that wraps the computer vision library [libccv](libccv.org). 

Read more about the original addon here: (https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCcv)

This modified version does has a face tracking and a pedestrian tracking example.
Both examples only run at very low frame rates at this point.
